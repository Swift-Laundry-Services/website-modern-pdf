     FORMS (Order a pickup, Contact / Free quote, Login)
     There is no backend yet. Pick ONE of these:

          Forms will POST FormData there and show a thank-you message.
       2. email: leave endpoint empty and set an address here; submitting
          opens the visitor's email app with the request pre-filled.
       3. Leave both empty (current state): after validation the visitor
          sees a "call or text us" panel with a pre-filled text message.

     TESTIMONIALS (Home page carousel). One entry per slide, shown in order.
     Only the first entry is a real review (the one in the design PDF).
     The rest are clearly labelled SAMPLE placeholders: they show a
     "Sample review" tag and no stars. To add a real review, replace a
     sample entry with the customer's words and set sample:false.
       quote     the review text (required)
       name      customer's name, e.g. "Maria G." (ask permission first)
       anonymous true = show a person icon instead of initials
       detail    what they ordered, e.g. "Wash & fold, weekly"
       location  e.g. "Garfield Heights, OH"
       rating    1-5 stars (real reviews only)
       sample    true = placeholder (shows the "Sample review" tag)
     Delete sample entries you don't need; the carousel adapts.
